## Week 4: Strings (Part 2)

- **Concept**: In the second part of the strings topic, you will further explore advanced string manipulation techniques and algorithms to solve complex problems efficiently.

### Techniques

1. String Matching Algorithms

   - **Description**: String matching algorithms are used to find the occurrences of a pattern within a larger string. You will learn about popular algorithms like Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) and Rabin-Karp for efficient string matching.

   - **Example problems**:
     - [ ] [Implement strStr()](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/)
     - [ ] [Repeated Substring Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-substring-pattern/)
     - [ ] [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

2. String Compression

   - **Description**: String compression involves representing a string in a shorter format by replacing repeated characters with a count. It is useful for problems that require minimizing memory usage or optimizing input/output operations.
