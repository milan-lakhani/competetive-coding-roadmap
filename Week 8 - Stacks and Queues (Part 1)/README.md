## Week 8: Stacks and Queues - Part 1

- **Concept**: Introduction to stacks and queues, basic operations, and problem-solving techniques.

### Techniques

1. Stack Implementation and Operations

   - **Description**: Learn how to implement a stack data structure and perform basic operations such as push, pop, and peek. Understand the LIFO (Last In, First Out) property of stacks.

2. Queue Implementation and Operations

   - **Description**: Understand the concept of queues and their implementation. Learn about basic operations such as enqueue, dequeue, and peek. Explore the FIFO (First In, First Out) property of queues.
