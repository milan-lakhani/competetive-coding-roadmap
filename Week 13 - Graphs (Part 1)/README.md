## Week 13: Graphs (Part 1)

- **Concept**: Introduction to Graphs and Graph Traversal Algorithms

### Techniques

1. Graph Representation
   - **Description**: Learn about different graph representations such as adjacency list and adjacency matrix.
   - **Resources**: [Graph Representation - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-and-its-representations/)
   - **Example Problems**:
     - [ ] [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)
     - [ ] [Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)

2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
   - **Description**: Explore the Breadth-First Search algorithm for graph traversal.
   - **Resources**: [Breadth-First Search (BFS) - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/breadth-first-search-or-bfs-for-a-graph/)
   - **Example Problems**:
     - [ ] [Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/)
     - [ ] [Word Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/)

3. Depth-First Search (DFS)
   - **Description**: Dive into the Depth-First Search algorithm for graph traversal.
   - **Resources**: [Depth-First Search (DFS) - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/depth-first-search-or-dfs-for-a-graph/)
