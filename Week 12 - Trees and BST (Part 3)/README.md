## Week 13: Trees - Part 3

- **Concept**: Advanced tree concepts, including trie (prefix tree), segment tree, and Fenwick tree.

### Techniques

1. Trie (Prefix Tree)

   - **Description**: Understand the trie data structure, also known as the prefix tree, and its applications. Learn how to insert, search, and delete words efficiently using a trie.

   - **Resources**:
     - [Trie - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trie-insert-and-search/)

   - **Example problems**:
     - [ ] [Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/)
     - [ ] [Word Search II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search-ii/)

2. Segment Tree

   - **Description**: Explore the segment tree data structure, which allows efficient querying of intervals in an array. Learn about constructing the tree, updating values, and performing range queries.

   - **Resources**:
     - [Segment Tree - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segment-tree-set-1-sum-of-given-range/)
     - [Range Sum Query - Mutable](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-mutable/)

   - **Example problems**:
     - [ ] [Count of Range Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-range-sum/)
     - [ ] [Range Sum Query 2D - Mutable](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-2d-mutable/)

3. Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)

   - **Description**: Learn about the Fenwick tree, also known as the binary indexed tree (BIT), and its applications for efficient prefix sum calculations and range updates.

   - **Resources**:
     - [Fenwick Tree - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-indexed-tree-or-fenwick-tree-2/)

   - **Example problems**:
     - [ ] [Count of Smaller Numbers After Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-smaller-numbers-after-self/)
     - [ ] [Range Sum Query - Mutable](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-mutable/)
