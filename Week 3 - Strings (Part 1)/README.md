## Week 3: Strings (Part 1)

- **Concept**: Strings are a sequence of characters and play a crucial role in coding interviews. In this week, you will dive into string manipulation techniques and algorithms to solve problems efficiently.

### Techniques

1. Two Pointers Technique for Strings

   - **Description**: The two pointers technique can also be applied to strings to solve various problems efficiently. By using two pointers that traverse the string, you can solve problems such as checking for palindromes or finding substrings with specific properties.

   - **Example problems**:
     - [ ] [Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)
     - [ ] [Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)
     - [ ] [Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)

2. String Manipulation and Pattern Matching

   - **Description**: String manipulation involves various operations such as concatenation, splitting, and replacing characters within a string. Pattern matching algorithms like Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) and Rabin-Karp are useful for solving string-related problems efficiently.
