## Week 11: Trees and Binary Search Trees - Part 2

- **Concept**: Advanced topics in trees and binary search trees, including tree traversal variations, balanced binary search trees, and common interview problems.

### Techniques

1. Tree Traversal Variations

   - **Description**: Explore variations of tree traversals, such as level order traversal, vertical order traversal, and boundary traversal. Learn how to implement these traversals using different approaches.

2. Balanced Binary Search Trees

   - **Description**: Learn about balanced binary search trees like AVL trees and Red-Black trees. Understand the concept of self-balancing and how these trees maintain their balance during insertions and deletions.
