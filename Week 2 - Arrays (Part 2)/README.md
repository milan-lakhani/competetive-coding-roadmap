## Week 2: Arrays (Part 2)

- **Concept**: In the second week of the Arrays topic, you will continue exploring advanced techniques and algorithms for array manipulation and problem-solving.

### Techniques

1. Prefix Sum Technique

   - **Description**: The prefix sum technique involves precomputing the cumulative sum of elements in an array to perform efficient range queries or solve problems based on prefix sums.

     - [Prefix Sum Technique - LeetCode Discuss](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1050391/prefix-sums-explained-or-everything-you-need-to-know)

   - **Example problems**:
     - [ ] [Maximum Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)

2. Binary Search on Arrays

   - **Description**: Binary search is an efficient search algorithm used to find a target element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search space in half. It has a time complexity of O(log n) and is often used as a building block for other algorithms.

     - [Binary Search - Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/binary-search/a/binary-search)

   - **Example problems**:
     - [ ] [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
     - [ ] [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
     - [ ] [Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/)

### Additional Problems

1. [ ] [Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)
2. [ ] [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)
3. [ ] [Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)
4. [ ] [Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)

Remember to allocate time for practicing additional problems, reviewing concepts, and seeking clarification whenever needed. Adjust the duration of each topic based on your learning pace and available time.
