## Week 1: Arrays (Part 1)

- **Concept**: Arrays are a fundamental data structure used to store a collection of elements of the same type. They provide efficient random access to elements using indices. In this week, you will learn various techniques for manipulating arrays and solving problems efficiently.

### Techniques

1. Two Pointers Technique

   - **Description**: The two pointers technique involves using two pointers to traverse an array or perform operations simultaneously from different ends or positions. It is commonly used to solve problems such as finding pairs that sum up to a target value or removing duplicates from a sorted array.

   - **Example problems**:
     - [ ] [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
     - [ ] [Three Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)
     - [ ] [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

2. Sliding Window Technique

   - **Description**: The sliding window technique involves maintaining a window of elements in an array and updating it as you iterate through the array. It is commonly used to solve problems involving subarrays or substrings, where you need to track a specific range or window of elements efficiently.
