## Week 10: Trees and Binary Search Trees - Part 1

- **Concept**: Introduction to trees, binary trees, and binary search trees. Traversals and basic operations.

### Techniques

1. Binary Trees

   - **Description**: Understand the concept of binary trees and learn about different types of binary tree traversals such as pre-order, in-order, and post-order. Explore recursive and iterative approaches for tree traversals.

     - [ ] [Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)

2. Binary Search Trees

   - **Description**: Learn about binary search trees (BST) and their properties. Understand how to perform insertion, deletion, and searching operations in BSTs. Explore techniques to validate and balance BSTs.
