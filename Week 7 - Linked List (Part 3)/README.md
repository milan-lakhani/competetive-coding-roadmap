## Week 7: Linked List - Part 3

- **Concept**: Advanced linked list techniques and problem-solving.

### Techniques

1. Skip List

   - **Description**: Explore the skip list data structure, which is a probabilistic data structure that allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations in a linked list.
